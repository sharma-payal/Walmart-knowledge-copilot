**Walmart Knowledge Copilot**

An LLM-powered intelligent assistant designed to support Walmart associates by providing contextual insights, automating tasks, and enabling natural language Q&A over enterprise knowledge.
This project demonstrates how retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), vector embeddings, and large language models (LLMs) can be combined to create a productivity-enhancing AI copilot for real-world enterprise use cases.

*Features*

- Conversational AI: Natural language Q&A for associates and merchants.
- RAG Pipeline: Integrates enterprise knowledge using vector embeddings for accurate retrieval.
- Multilingual Support: Expands accessibility across global teams.
- Task Automation: Streamlines repetitive workflows to improve efficiency.
- Data Privacy: Designed with enterprise governance and scalability in mind.


*ðŸ›  Tech Stack*

- LLM: LLaMA (via Hugging Face)
- Vector Database: FAISS / Milvus
- Frameworks: LangChain
- Deployment: Streamlit / FastAPI
- Version Control: Git + GitHub


*ðŸ“‚ How to Run Locally*

- Clone this repo : git clone https://github.com/sharma-payal/Walmart-knowledge-copilot.git
  cd Walmart-knowledge-copilot
- Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
- Run the app: streamlit run app.py

  *ðŸ“Œ Roadmap*
 - Add voice input/output for conversational use cases
 - Expand support for more enterprise knowledge sources
-  Optimize retrieval performance for large datasets
-  Deploy on cloud for global accessibility
